Here are a few choice quotes about peak oil from Kenneth Deffeyes, a long-time oil man who actually worked with King Hubbert. From [Hubbert's Peak](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691141190/hubberts-peak) (originally published in 2001), page 12:  

>My own opinion is that the peak in world oil production may even occur before 2004. What happens if I am wrong? I would be delighted to be proved wrong. It would mean that we have a few additional years to reduce our consumption of crude oil. However, it would take a lot of unexpectedly good news to postpone the peak to 2010. My message would remain much the same: crude oil is much too valuable to be burned as a fuel.  

Hubbert's Peak, page 164:

>In the long run, the eventual use for oil will be for manufacturing useful organic chemicals. I expect our grandchildren to ask, "You burned it? All those lovely organic molecules, you just burned it?" Sorry, we burned it.  

And from Beyond Oil (published in 2005), page 33:

>OPEC was founded to stabilize world oil prices. \[...\] If the price fell below \$22 \[per barrel\], OPEC would cut back production. If the price went above \$28, they could flood the market with oil. Since 2002, OPEC has been producing essentially at full capacity. Early in 2004, with oil prices near \$33, OPEC announced a _cut_ in production. The good news is that OPEC is no longer in charge of the price of oil. The bad news is that nobody is in charge.
