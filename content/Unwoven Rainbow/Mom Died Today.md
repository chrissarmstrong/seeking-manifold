My mother died today, after a fairly long life full of many happy occasions as well as some pretty tough times.  

She died after a long (_very_ long, nearly 30 year) fight with Parkinson's disease. The last ten years in particular were difficult. Her health declined steadily, and [[Taking the Kids?|as I described earlier]], near the end she had trouble feeding herself and seemed mentally there only part of the time. At times we questioned among ourselves how good her quality of life really was recently, but Mom kept soldiering on. Until today, anyway.  
  
The problems started on Thanksgiving day (a day that already has special significance for me, which I'll describe in a future post). Mom started Thursday relatively well, according to the nursing home staff. But by the afternoon, when my sister went to pick her up for dinner, Mom was running a fever and seemed unusually unresponsive. Everyone decided she shouldn't go out. By the time my sister arrived home half an hour later (without Mom), the nursing home staff had called to say that they were sending her to the ER.  
  
Thursday night things looked pretty bad. Mom's body clearly had several things going wrong at once. Later in the night she was moved to the ICU.  
  
By Friday morning, after hours of intense treatment, she was somewhat responsive. My sister and I spent much of the day with her, doing our best (between tears) to talk about some of the 'good old days', our fond memories of childhood, and Mom's life with her grandchildren. I'm very happy we had that time together. Mom could not talk at all with the ventilation tube down her throat, and her eyes never completely opened, but she clearly wanted to communicate. She nodded her head "Yes" or shook it "No" to questions. Several times I'm pretty sure she was crying.  
  
We also got a chance to ask her some questions about treatment options. She clearly nodded "No" to any surgery, as well as to dialysis. In the end she never recovered enough for these to be options anyway, but we get some sense of closure knowing that Mom seemed to be ready to leave.  
  
Mom's health rapidly declined through Friday night. By this morning, she was completely unresponsive, and looked significantly worse than just 12 hours before. Her doctor said that all signs pointed to her body failing on multiple fronts at once, and he thought there was essentially zero chance for a positive outcome. She was clearly going to die, and the question was how we could best help her do it. We decided we didn't want to wait any longer than necessary. The doctor called in a palliative care doctor and nurse, who walked us through the best way to get Mom off of the life sustaining drugs and ventilation, while providing the right things to ensure that—if she were still aware—she would go comfortably.  
  
The doctors expected Mom to die pretty quickly once all of the resuscitative support was removed, and she did. Happily, Alex and our kids and my sister were in the hospital this morning, so we all got to be with Mom as she left us. It was a tremendously sad experience, but I'm so grateful that we could all be there to let Mom know how much she was loved, and to support each other. I cannot imagine going through something like this alone.  
  
I'm also grateful that in the end, Mom went pretty quickly, and didn't appear to be in any pain. And I'm grateful for the staff at her nursing home, who helped her through the last several years. And for the hospital staff, who were totally supportive and understanding in Mom's last few days.  
  
And I'm grateful that Mom's long struggle is finally over.  
  
We love you.
