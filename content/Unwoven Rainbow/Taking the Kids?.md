My mother is now largely confined to a wheelchair, since standing up without help is just an accident waiting to happen. Her balance is poor, Parkinson disease affects her ability to step more than a few inches at a time, and she has lost a lot of her vision to glaucoma. Her condition seems to be declining quickly in the last year or so. In the last several months she's started to have trouble lifting her hands to her mouth, so now she is mostly fed by the nursing home staff. She often has trouble speaking at more than a whisper (another symptom of Parkinson disease) and can be very difficult to understand.  

Mentally she comes and goes. Very recently she has trouble staying with a conversation for more than a few minutes. One minute she'll ask who I am, and complain about the people gathering in the corner of the room ("No one's there, Mom â€” that's just a cabinet..."). A few minutes later, in a fleeting window of complete lucidity, she'll express frustration at the fact that she seems to be confused about what is real and what is not. It is painful and sad to watch.  

I often think fondly of a picture I took of her when I was twelve and she was, well, about my age now. **Wow, life is short.**

Last weekend she was pretty out of it. At the end of our visit I wheeled her into the dining area for lunch while Alex and the kids headed down to the car. It was only then that Mom started tuning in. After trading a few coherent sentences I realized everyone would be waiting for me downstairs. I got up to go.  
  
"We're heading out now. See you next week."  
  
She looked up at me. She said, more clearly than usual: "So I'm taking the kids?"  
  
That caught me a bit by surprise, and I chuckled, wincing at the same time.  
  
"Oh, no, you don't need to worry about that, Mom. We'll take the kids with us. You just stay here... and we love you."
