My mother has been in a nursing home for a couple of years now, in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. We visit on weekends.  
  
Sadly, the aging elevators at the nursing home often behave in a way that mirrors some residents:  
  
Me: Up, please.  
  
\[No elevator comes.\]
  
Me: Up...  
  
\[Still no elevator.\]
  
Me: _Up!_  
  
\[Both elevators open.\]
  
Me (stepping in): Sigh... Second floor, please.  
  
\[Doors open at the third floor...\]
  
Then a few hours later, leaving the building:  
  
Me (entering passcode on the elevator security control): 12345, down please.  
  
\[No elevator...\]
  
Me: _12345, down please._  
  
\[Elevator opens, one of the nurses steps out.\]
  
Me: First floor, please.  
  
\[Door closes, then nothing.\]
  
Me (after flicking elevator on / off switch): First floor, please.  
  
\[Elevator stops on first floor, but only the rear service door opens.\]
  
Me (stepping out, welling up with tears at how bad the situation is getting): See you next week...
