![[The Unwoven Rainbow.png|200]]

From 2007 through 2010 I had a blog, the Unwoven Rainbow, which has been out of commission for years. Recently I went on an archaeological expedition through the old posts I'd archived. It was quite the reminder of past times, and I thought a few of them were worth re-posting.

At the time I was convinced that two huge issues were about to bear down on humanity—climate change and peak oil—and that the latter would impact us sooner than the former. I was wrong about the timing of peak oil; it seems that climate change is hitting us first. But both are fundamentally about exponential growth and resource depletion in a scenario with finite resources, and both matter in the long-term view of things.

I can credit my waking up to that entire situation to getting (back) into biking, learning to garden, thinking more about renewables, etc. For that I'm grateful.

This was also a period in which my mother was finally losing her struggle with Parkinson's disease, and a few posts reflect on that.
