title: Unwoven Rainbow Archives

From about 2007 through 2010 I had a blog, the Unwoven Rainbow. The site has been out of commission for years. Recently I went on an archaeological expedition through the old posts I had there. These are a few select posts from those days.

At the time I was convinced that two huge issues were about to bear down on humanity - climate change and peak oil - and that the latter would impact us sooner than the former. It looks like I was wrong about that.
