Consider this a kind of 'conversational resume', like what you'd get if you quizzed me in person on my work history. If you want the formal 'toot your own horn' version, [here you go](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6jb39aw8ofdxu3hsuazpn/Chris_Armstrong_resume_public_2024.03.pdf?rlkey=35zrlup5yrb925tkn4z4lb4ns&dl=0).

# A Glorious Self-Study Sabbatical

My work since leaving Verizon is largely documented in [[Little Experiments/index|Little Experiments]].

# Verizon

I spent 6 years at Verizon ('17 - '23) doing management for a couple of products that helped get the Verizon Business Group into the AI / ML space (this group sells products to B2B customers, not part of the consumer group that most people think of when they hear 'Verizon').

The role was classic product management, interacting with a large group of stakeholders at a big company, as well as managing several vendors.

The job was my introduction to the AI space, but the more I learned the more I wanted to get really hands-on. In June of 2023 I left Verizon to dig into AI full-time. [[Leaving Verizon|Here's the skinny on that move]].

# Perfect Sense

Prior to joining Verizon I was at Perfect Sense (now Brightspot) for 7 years. I was with the company as it grew from about 40 people to 130. I did an interesting combination of product management for the in-house content management and digital asset management systems that we sold and consulting work for Perfect Sense customers.

I learned a lot about the content management space, as well as operating in a sort of consulting role.

(It was also a welcome break from working in the AOL big-company bureaucracy. Everyone owes it to themselves to work in a variety of places from small to large; it helps immensely to be able to compare different styles of management, different ways of structuring an organization, and the like.)

# AOL

I spent a decade (!) at AOL, starting right in the AOL Time-Warner heyday. AOL was trying to get into the streaming content business, and needed help understanding the world of hardware, so I spent a while focused on set-top boxes and cable infrastructure. Before long, however, I transitioned to a product management role.

Over the course of my product management time at AOL I learned a ton about social media (anyone remember AOL Member Directory and Message Boards?), and helped transition a number of products from proprietary technology to the standards-based stuff that was taking over the web.

I also got experience in various management roles, including technical management of dev and QA teams (early in the days of agile!) and directing product management teams.

# Jefferson Lab

After I did the research for my doctorate at [Jefferson Lab](https://www.jlab.org/) in Virginia and graduating, I spent a year and a half doing a post-doc there. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there; this was when the lab was just coming online, and it was arguably *the* place in the US to do nuclear physics at the time. The lab was populated with extraordinary folks from around the world.

I departed because the web was just taking off, and I really felt an urge to be part of that. Nowadays you'd call it FOMO.

# Education stuff

## Physics @ William & Mary

My PhD is in hadronic physics (experimental), from [W&M](https://www.wm.edu/). My research was done at Jefferson Lab (above) and involved an experiment looking into behavior of a particular resonance of the proton. You can find my dissertation [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9rmzv5ib6iunr9cu7v0p9/Chris_Armstrong_thesis_public.pdf?rlkey=jafuelofn54fougnngy33twbb&dl=0). I think the topic is very cool, and I'm always puzzled that others are interested only when battling insomnia  :-P

## Electrical engineering @ University of VA

My BS is in electrical engineering, from [UVa](https://www.virginia.edu/). I was there to see the transition from punch cards to the new-fangled PC. Nuff said.

# *Really* old work history

For the first 5 years out of undergrad (EE), I worked in a few roles as an engineer designing radio frequency (RF) systems (RF circuits, radio systems, antennas, and the like). At the end of this stretch I caught the physics bug and decided to go to grad school.
