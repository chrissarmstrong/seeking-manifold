# Research Interests

Here's a laundry list of research topics I'm interested in:

- Democratization, local LLMs, and doing more with low resources
	- LoRA and QLoRA
	- Efficient learning: TinyStories, curriculum learning
	- Model merging
	- Adaptive / conditional computation
- Alternative architectures
	- JEPA
	- SSMs, Mamba, MoE-Mamba, BlackMamba
	- Mixture of Experts (MoE)
	- Text diffusion, Vec2Text
	- Reservoir computing
	- GLOM
	- Diffusion models
- Alignment
	- Mechanistic interpretability
	- Safety and bias considerations
- Addressing shortcomings of existing systems
	- Time as a first-class citizen: multimodal, spatiotemporal representation of knowledge / understanding
	- World models, reasoning, system 2 thinking and planning
	- Sample efficiency
	- Context length
- Biological connections and inspirations / AI and neuroscience intersections
	- Predictive coding
	- The free energy principle
	- Fovea and saccades
	- Ventral and dorsal vision streams
	- Spiking neural networks (SNNs), neuromorphic computing
