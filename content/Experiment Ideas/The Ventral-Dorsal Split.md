This is an ongoing exploration in a set of ideas I've been thinking about related to the role that the ventral / dorsal split, the fovea, and eye saccades play in development of intelligence.

Not much to talk about yet. Currently I'm working through some details of the dataset I want to create:

as well as the baseline architecture:

The idea here is to get something working to serve as a baseline for exploring the ideas I discussed in this page about [[The Vision System|the vision system]].
