Sometimes I come across a technical concept that is too big to be a single Anki card. In order to get my head around such a thing and commit it to memory, it helps for me to distill it into its minimal form (foregoing detail in the interest of brevity).

When I do this, I also find myself coming back to it frequently to refresh my memory.

This is a collection of such distillations.
