Hey there! I'm Chris Armstrong. This is a site that collects some of the stuff I'm thinking about and working on.

Some background: I'm a former electrical engineer (mostly analog, antenna, and signal processing) and physicist (medium-energy nuclear, experimental). For quite a while, though, I've been doing product management (a variety of web products, from social media to content management and chat bots), mixed in with some tech management. [[A Conversational Work History|More about my work history here.]]

In 2018 (while doing product management for a machine learning-based product at Verizon) I started getting *very* interested in all of the research around ML and AI. Before long, my nights and weekends were spent poring over the academic papers that were coming out of arxiv.org as if from a fire hose. And for the first time in many years I took up a new programming language (Python) and got myself an [[I Am Here|itty-bitty GTX 1070Ti GPU]].

In the spring of 2023 I decided to [[Leaving Verizon|quit my day job]], if only for a while, so I could focus more fully on this AI thing and redirect my work life accordingly. Now it's nearly a year later, and with a better sense of the overall landscape of AI activity I'm starting to think about reentering the workforce.
