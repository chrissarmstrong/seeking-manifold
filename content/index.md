Hey there! I'm Chris. This is a site that collects some of the stuff I'm thinking about and working on.

Some background: I'm a former electrical engineer (lots of analog and signal stuff) and physicist (medium-energy nuclear, experimental). For quite a while, though, I've been doing product management (a variety of web products, from social media to content management and chat bots).

In 2018 (while doing product management for an ML-based product at Verizon) I started getting *very* interested in all of the research around machine learning and AI. Before long, my nights and weekends were spent poring over the academic papers that were coming out of arxiv.org as if from a firehose. And for the first time in many years I took up a new programming language (Python) and got myself an itty-bitty (GTX 1070) GPU.

In the spring of 2023 I decided to quit my day job (if only for a while) so I could focus more fully on this AI thing and redirect my work life accordingly. Now it's nearly a year later, and with a better sense of the overall landscape of AI activity I'm starting to think about reentering the workforce.

Here's a map of what I've been up to lately:
