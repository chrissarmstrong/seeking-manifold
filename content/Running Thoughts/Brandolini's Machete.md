I'm so tired of hearing people like â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ[^1] go on (in interviews or talks) spouting multiple poorly-supported points in rapid succession. It's like he wields a bump-stock for BS.

I want a real-time LLM that has access to trusted sources and listens to content (interviews, talks, broadcasts, etc.) and in real time highlights places where statements can be challenged. It features a big indicator like the Pants-on-Fire meter, together with counterpoints / commentary on statements that are counter to fact (or just highlights when something is heavily opinion-based).

We'll gift it to Lex Fridman and other interviewers so they can challenge guests / interviewees in real time. I like Lex a lot; he's a good interviewer (in the sense that he can hold an engaging conversation with just about anyone) and seems like a very good person. But when he has someone like â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ[^2] on, Lex just gets [galloped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop).

We can call this new tool *[Brandolini's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini's_law) Machete*, because it's going to help us cut through the bullshit.

I could even use it before posting: "Hey, could you check out this statement for me?"  ðŸ˜€
