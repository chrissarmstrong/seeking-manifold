This is a collection of small AI / ML experiments I've done in the last few years as I work on my coding and implementation skills and test out some of the ideas bubbling around in my head. Much of the work has been in the year since [[Leaving Verizon|leaving my job to dig into AI full time]].

An explicit goal of this last year has been to dabble. When I started I was wary of getting pulled into a major effort that would suck up all my time, so aimed to spend no more than a month or two on individual projects. I also wanted to get my hands dirty in a number of different areas. The result, for what it is worth, is a collection of small projects, some of them unfinished—and several of which I would like to pick back up again if I have the opportunity.

When I embark on one of these experiments, my objective (aside from having a good learning experience) is to find a large effect (like 5 or 10%) or go home. I'm trying to ruthlessly prioritize work—and usually anxious to move on to another idea—so if there's only a 1% effect, then I'm generally not interested enough to invest more time. I'll write up just enough to indicate what it is that I was looking into.

As a result, in many cases what you're seeing is the equivalent of me scribbling some ideas onto paper, realizing I'm heading down a useless path, then wadding up the paper and tossing it in the bin. Live and learn.

My machine has a little ole GPX 1070Ti (8 GiB VRAM). Due to this limitation I'm usually looking for interesting things to do using small models (e.g., GPTNeo-124M) and modest datasets (e.g., subsets of TinyStories).

There's nothing *too* exciting here (no breakthrough results), but I want to document some of what I've been up to. I also want to get better about [doing it in public](https://doingitinpublic.com/) (an entirely safe link, btw).
