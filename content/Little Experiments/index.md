This is a collection of small AI / ML experiments I've done in the last year or so as I work on my coding and implementation skills and test out some of the ideas bubbling around in my head.

My machine has a little ole GPX 1070Ti. Due to this limitation I'm usually looking for interesting things to look into using small models (e.g., GPTNeo-124M) and modest datasets (e.g., subsets of TinyStories).

There's nothing *too* exciting here, but I felt like I should make an effort to minimally document some of what I did on my sabbatical. When I embark on one of these experiments, my objective (aside from having a good learning experience) is to find a large effect (say 10% or so) or go home. Since I'm always anxious to move on to a new idea, if (say) there's only a 1% effect, then I'm generally not interested enough to invest more time. I'll write up just enough to indicate what it is that I was looking into.

In some cases what you're seeing is the equivalent of me scribbling some ideas onto paper, realizing I'm heading down a useless path, then wadding up the paper and tossing it in the bin  ðŸ˜ž
