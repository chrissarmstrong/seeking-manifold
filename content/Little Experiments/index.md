This is a collection of small AI / ML experiments I've done in the last couple of years as I work on my coding and implementation skills and test out some of the ideas bubbling around in my head.

My machine is a little ole GPX 1070Ti (8 GiB VRAM). Due to this limitation I'm usually looking for interesting things to do using small models (e.g., GPTNeo-124M) and modest datasets (e.g., subsets of TinyStories).

There's nothing *too* exciting here (no breakthrough results), but I want to document some of what I've been up to. I also want to get better about [doing it in public](https://doingitinpublic.com/) (an entirely safe link, btw).

When I embark on one of these experiments, my objective (aside from having a good learning experience) is to find a large effect (say 10% or so) or go home. Since I'm always anxious to move on to a new idea, if (say) there's only a 1% effect, then I'm generally not interested enough to invest more time. I'll write up just enough to indicate what it is that I was looking into.

So in many cases what you're seeing is the equivalent of me scribbling some ideas onto paper, realizing I'm heading down a useless path, then wadding up the paper and tossing it in the bin. Live and learn.
