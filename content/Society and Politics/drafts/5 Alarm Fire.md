Hey everyone,

I rarely post here, but today is an exception. I'm reaching out because our democracy is under threat, and many aren't aware of the magnitude or urgency of the situation.

A coup is happening in DC, the United States is facing its greatest constitutional crisis, and our democracy is at risk. Traditional media isn't covering this adequately, so it’s up to us to spread awareness.

I’m fortunate to be off of work right now, allowing me time to follow these developments closely and speak openly about this.

Here’s the urgency: Elon Musk, backed by President Trump, is working illegally and unconstitutionally to control and dismantle key parts of the federal government. Your personal data has already been compromised, and trust in the US around the world is eroding rapidly.

**I urge you to take action now.** We're at a critical juncture; if we don't immediately halt this slide into authoritarianism, we will lose the country that's given us so much.

Here's where to start coming up to speed:

1. Watch [this Heather Cox Richardson interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-78R0monV4) (ad blockers & 1.25x playback speed recommended).
2. Check out Bluesky for updates and discussions. You should grab a 'starter pack' to immediately follow a group of people; I recommend [Marc Elias's](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/marcelias.bsky.social/3lazeus5cvh27).

Start regularly calling your elected representatives and letting them know that these actions must not stand. DM me if you'd like recos on other resources or want to discuss further.

Let's stand together to protect our democracy. Time is of the essence.
